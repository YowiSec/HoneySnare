# HoneySnare

HoneySnare is a smart contract honeypot designed to attract malicious bot interactions on Ethereum and Layer 2 networks (such as Arbitrum and Optimism). The project includes a Rust backend to monitor, log, and archive bot behavior for further analysis.

## Features
- Solidity-based honeypot contract for Ethereum and Layer 2 networks
- Rust backend for real-time event logging and archiving
- Automated compression of logs for efficient storage
- Suitable for testing vulnerabilities and tracking bot activity
